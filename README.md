# ArcGIS_Build_AGOL_Database
Build a file geodatabase from template files.  
This tool streamlines the production of a file geodatabase using 
template files that are readily modifiable by non-technical staff.
Allows the end users to interact with csv tables instead of 
database creation dialogs in Arcmap and systematizes the database production
process.
